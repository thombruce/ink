GENETIC LABORATORY - FLUORESCENT LIGHTING</h3><p>A petri-dish lays dormant upon a stainless steel desk.</p><p>From a pipette, a fluid is squeezed onto the surface of the dish.</p><p>The dish is lifted and manoeuvred to beneath a microscope.</p><p>Adjustments are made to the focus of the microscope and ANANKE peers into its scopes.</p><p>She sees cells in the fluid as they undergo the process of mitosis.</p><p>Carefully, she retrieves the petri-dish and pours its contents into a specially designed test-tube.</p><p>The test-tube is then placed into a holder, aside nine others.</p><p>The ten test tubes are then carefully carried to a special chamber, appearing very much like a refrigerator.</p><p>They are placed upon a shelf in the unit alongside several other rows of liquid-containing test tubes.</p><p>ANANKE closes the refrigerator unit's door.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - LATER</h3><p>ANANKE opens the refrigerator unit's door and retrieves a collection of test tubes.</p><p>She places the test tubes and their rack upon a steel desk.</p><p>One by one, a pipe is placed into each of the test tubes, meeting with the liquid within them.</p><p>A button is pressed.</p><p>The contents of a test tube are drained and transported to a machine, designed to incubate the fluid.</p><p>This happens in turn for the rest of the test tubes, as the next button is pressed sequentially along its row.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - DIM FLUORESCENT LIGHTING</h3><p>Within one chamber of the incubating machine, a form can be seen to be growing.</p><p>It is growing, this action accelerated, from invisibly microscopic.</p><p>At first, no form can be determined.</p><p>Soon, stumps have formed and an entity with four limbs begins to take shape.</p><p>It grows to resemble a human foetus and continues to take shape in this vein.</p><p>Altogether, there appear to be twenty-two active chambers with another three unlit, inactive.</p><p>Each chamber glows and contains a rapidly growing life-form, each a human baby.</p><p>This is except for one chamber which appears to contain conjoined twins.</p><p>The chamber containing conjoined twins is seen in detail.</p><p>The twins within grow, with time still rapidly increased, and become more separate with time.</p><p>The two life-forms ultimately separate into independent units.</p><p>Their forms grow around one another in the chamber as they become full-sized babies, struggling for space.</p><p>In other units, the respective life-forms comfortably grow to be full-sized babies.</p><p>The passage of time is slowed, not quite returned to normal as the lights are turned on.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - FLUORESCENT LIGHTING</h3><p>A group of technicians now, ANANKE among them, approach each of the chambers in turn.</p><p>Their motion is accelerated as they remove the babies from their chambers.</p><p>Each baby is then moved to a larger chamber, one which a fully grown adult might fit comfortably within.</p><p>The twins are separated so that twenty-three incubation chambers are occupied in total.</p><p>Each infant has a series of wires connected to it as it lays in the base of a chamber.</p><p>These incubation chambers are then closed and sealed.</p><p>The technicians, and ANANKE, leave the lab as the lower area of each chamber is partially filled with liquid.</p><p>The lights are switched off.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - DIM FLUORESCENT LIGHTING</h3><p>Time is accelerated once more as each infant grows at the base of its respective incubation chamber.</p><p>They become toddlers as we focus on details of their growth.</p><p>Fingers become less stubby, elongating with development.</p><p>Arms lengthen.</p><p>Legs lengthen.</p><p>Facial features become defined.</p><p>Eyelashes grow out of eyelids.</p><p>Eyebrows grow above the eyes.</p><p>Toenails appear trimmed and then grow rapidly, then appear trimmed again as we see the foot lengthen and widen.</p><p>Hair on heads grows, then appears cut, grows again and then appears cut again as the faces it frames grow and change.</p><p>In each chamber, postpubertal forms now stand and grow taller.</p><p>As the acceleration of time slows, all are adults with their heads shaved.</p><p>Their hair grows, but not by much before...</p><p>One of the men inside one of the chambers wakes up.</p><p>This man is ZAGREUS.</p><h3>INT. ZAGREUS' INCUBATION CHAMBER - DEEP BLUE LIGHT</h3><p>We look from roughly ZAGREUS' perspective, turning across the window and searching the outside room.</p><p>Out there, there are several strange, blurred chambers, each seeming to contain a bipedal life-form.</p><p>Inside this chamber, the echo of ZAGREUS' breathing can be heard rapidly increasing.</p><p>ZAGREUS leans forward and we see his reflection form in the glass in front of him.</p><p>His face comes to meet the reflection with a shocked expression and with his breathing quickly fogging the glass.</p><p>His reflection becomes obscured due to condensation.</p><p>ZAGREUS raises a limp wrist to the chamber door, looking down to his own limbs with the same look of panic and confusion.</p><p>A sudden hiss is heard and ZAGREUS flinches wildly within his chamber.</p><p>The next moment comes and the chamber door is taken away from him.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - DIM INCANDESCENT LIGHTING</h3><p>ZAGREUS falls violently out from his chamber.</p><p>His form collapses to the floor, limp and in slow writhing.</p><p>The expression of panic on ZAGREUS' face turns to a great childlike misery.</p><p>He whimpers at first.</p><p>And then ZAGREUS cries as though a baby.</p><p>A hiss is heard from across the room.</p><p>And then another hiss, closer.</p><p>And another.</p><p>Mechanical whirrings sound as chamber doors open.</p><p>ZAGREUS is weeping, his head motioning with his eyes trying to lift his vision to see and failing.</p><p>Bodies can be heard falling to the floor, smacking against the cold steel grates.</p><p>More whimpers and crying occurs from around the room as more hisses sound to signal the opening of yet more chambers.</p><p>ZAGREUS attempts to move his form to see.</p><p>He raises a limp arm and forces his wrist against the floor but is unable to push himself up.</p><p>He rolls back into his collapsing arm and continues to whimper, and cry more loudly.</p><p>From above, we can see the assortment of men and women now lying naked, faces toward the floors.</p><p>Their bodies writhe weakly as they cry.</p><p>A final chamber hisses and then whirs open.</p><p>A female form, HARMONIA, falls out and is motionless against the ground.</p><p>In total, seven forms are motionless; the males, EPAPHUS, LATINUS, ARGUS and PELASGUS, the females, HARMONIA, HEROPHILE and ALAGONIA.</p><p>Sixteen forms remain alive and writhe upon the ground, weeping. They are the males, ZAGREUS, APOLLO, ORION, HERMES, HEPHAESTUS, twins AMPHION and ZETHUS, HELLEN, LACEDAEMON, LOCRUS and GRACEUS, and the females, ARTEMIS, ATHENA, MELINOE, THEBE and KEROESSA.</p><p>Each of the sixteen living forms writhes upon the floor and cries as though a baby, but can do nothing more.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - LATER</h3><p>ZAGREUS is lay upon the ground, his eyes closed with eye-lids fluttering.</p><p>His face shows discomfort despite the rest.</p><p>Around the laboratory, whimpers and whines can still be heard.</p><p>APOLLO is collapsed near to a wall.</p><p>He raises an arm up and clutches at a lab coat hung from the wall.</p><p>Clumsily, APOLLO pulls himself up onto his knees and forces his arms to lock and hold himself upright.</p><p>He looks around the room, an expression of terrible fear upon his face, his eyes red from crying.</p><p>Near to APOLLO is a woman who looks familiar to him.</p><p>This woman is ARTEMIS, his sister.</p><p>He looks to her and she looks back at him, each struck with fear and sadness.</p><p>APOLLO crawls to ARTEMIS.</p><p>She quakes, shivering with fear at his approach.</p><p>He rests his hand on her face and caresses it somewhat violently.</p><p>At this, ARTEMIS flinches and struggles to turn her head away.</p><p>APOLLO takes back his hand, apologetically.</p><p>He rests into himself, perching uncomfortably, and begins to cry.</p><p>His cry wails loudly within the laboratory.</p><p>ZAGREUS' eyes open, startled from his slumber.</p><p>He turns his face toward APOLLO and stares, then beginning to cry himself.</p><p>Crying, and seeing that APOLLO is sat up, ZAGREUS attempts to lift himself and mimic the position of APOLLO.</p><p>He forces his body up with his arms and attempts to drag his legs under himself.</p><p>Failing, he collapses.</p><p>But he tries again, this time succeeding in holding himself up long enough to sit perched on his legs.</p><p>He shows an expression of great pain while managing this.</p><p>Then the expression of pain recedes back into his whimpered cry.</p><p>He looks to APOLLO and wails loudly.</p><p>APOLLO is startled from his own wailing, and it is diminished into just a whimper.</p><p>He looks to ZAGREUS.</p><p>ZAGREUS looks back at APOLLO as they each keep from crying.</p><p>They recognise accomplishment in one another and feel pride enough to refrain from further wailing.</p><p>ZAGREUS bows his head, choking on his prevented tears.</p><p>He examines his own body; the arms which hold him up and the legs which he places himself upon to sit.</p><p>He looks to his own sister, MELINOE, who faces away from him, and to HEPHAESTUS who lays toward his other side and looks toward him.</p><p>ZAGREUS crawls to HEPHAESTUS as HEPHAESTUS looks toward him, whimpering.</p><p>ZAGREUS then takes his hand and places it on HEPHAESTUS' arm.</p><p>He shifts HEPHAESTUS' arm, attempting to match the position of his own which still supports himself.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS understands and takes ZAGREUS' lead.</p><p>He helps to shift his own arms below himself.</p><p>Then he takes it upon himself to push the weight of his torso upwards.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - LATER</h3><p>APOLLO and ARTEMIS are sat facing one another.</p><p>Their tear ducts are long dried up but grief still falls upon their faces.</p><p>ARTEMIS is softly examining APOLLO's face with her hand as he rests with his own hand on her shoulder.</p><p>He examines the space around them, the room and others in it.</p><p>ARTEMIS moves her hand down APOLLO's face and neck, and finds a branding below his left collar-bone.</p><p>She pressures the branding, rubbing her fingers into the word - “APOLLO”.</p><p>APOLLO looks down to his collar-bone, where ARTEMIS is applying pressure.</p><p>He removes his own hand from her shoulder and brings it to his branding.</p><p>Then he looks back to ARTEMIS, to her collar bone, and raises his hand to where she is branded.</p><p>He gently strokes the word written on her - “ARTEMIS”.</p><p>Across the room, HEPHAESTUS is helping the twins, AMPHION and ZETHUS, to get themselves upright.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS pays note to the fact that AMPHION and ZETHUS are identical, looking back from one to the other with a curiosity forming from behind his grief.</p><p>He looks to others in the room who are not identical, and back to the twins as he helps them to sit upright.</p><p>ZAGREUS also is helping others to sit upright.</p><p>Having tended to HERMES, he sees ATHENA managing to get herself aloft but crawls to her in offering of his service.</p><p>Behind ZAGREUS, MELINOE is sat looking away from the living men and women now finding their way upright.</p><p>She is instead looking toward the dead with a look of sombre contemplation on her face.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - LATER</h3><p>All of the living individuals are now sat upright in various positions of discomfort.</p><p>They are each examining their surroundings and one another.</p><p>Every one of them is branded with their name. Respectively, APOLLO, ARTEMIS, ZAGREUS, MELINOE, ORION, HERMES, ATHENA, HEPHAESTUS, THEBE, KEROESSA, AMPHION, ZETHUS, HELLEN, LACEDAEMON, LOCRUS and GRACEUS.</p><p>ATHENA has dragged herself to the side of the room.</p><p>She uses the wall as a means to pull herself upwards, but falls clumsily back down onto her legs.</p><p>APOLLO watches as she attempts it again.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS too is watching but then looks to APOLLO.</p><p>APOLLO turns his glance quickly toward HEPHAESTUS, as though startled by motion in the corner of his vision.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS looks beyond APOLLO, to the lab coats hung behind him.</p><p>APOLLO turns his head and eyes, looking for what HEPHAESTUS is seeing.</p><p>He examines the air in front of his face as he does so, as though that might be it but ultimately finds the lab coats.</p><p>He turns back to HEPHAESTUS and then looks back to ATHENA.</p><p>ATHENA now, has stood herself on two feet with her hands supporting her against the wall.</p><p>APOLLO turns back to the lab coats and crawls toward them.</p><p>He clutches at one and pulls at it to lift himself upwards.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS watches as APOLLO fails to find his feet and flounders at the side of the room.</p><p>He begins crawling to APOLLO.</p><p>ARTEMIS watches attentively as her brother flounders at the lab coats.</p><p>ORION also looks on, shifting himself forward instinctively as though ready to attempt the same - but stopping, unconscious of his will to do so.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS meets with the now breathless and collapsed APOLLO, who is beginning to well up toward crying.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS places a hand on APOLLO's shoulder.</p><p>APOLLO halts from crying and looks to HEPHAESTUS.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS then uses APOLLO as a crutch and, also clutching at a lab-coat, hoists himself upwards.</p><p>He plants his hand against the wall as he does so and finds his feet.</p><p>APOLLO looks up to HEPHAESTUS and HEPHAESTUS looks back down to him.</p><p>Clutching now back at the lab-coat, HEPHAESTUS lowers his arm to APOLLO.</p><p>APOLLO grabs at it and HEPHAESTUS helps to lift APOLLO as APOLLO himself climbs HEPHAESTUS' arm and comes to rest upon his shoulder and against the wall.</p><p>The two are ecstatic, almost laughing to the point of tears but being unable for their glands being exhausted.</p><p>Their bodies spasm as they try to comprehend the joy and each must grasp the row of lab-coats and one another in order to prevent from falling.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - LATER</h3><p>ZAGREUS crawls across the room, headed toward where APOLLO is knelt and HEPHAESTUS still stands against the wall.</p><p>As he does so, ORION watches.</p><p>ZAGREUS passes ORION by as ORION follows him with his eyes.</p><p>Finally, ZAGREUS reaches APOLLO.</p><p>He places his hand on APOLLO's shoulder and begins thrusting himself upward.</p><p>APOLLO shifts under ZAGREUS' weight and ZAGREUS collapses.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS extends his arm to ZAGREUS.</p><p>ZAGREUS takes it and HEPHAESTUS pulls him upwards as APOLLO now does his best to push ZAGREUS upright.</p><p>ORION, having watched all of this, is crawling towards them.</p><p>He arrives at APOLLO and APOLLO prepares himself to help push ORION upwards.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS takes ORION's arm and lifts him.</p><p>APOLLO watches as ZAGREUS, HEPHAESTUS and ORION clutch lab-coats and coat-hooks to keep themselves stood upright.</p><p>He turns to see ARTEMIS, his sister.</p><p>She has began to crawl towards them.</p><p>Seeing this, APOLLO raises his arm upwards and clutches at one of the lab-coats.</p><p>He hoists himself upright as ORION reaches under his shoulder and helps to pull him up.</p><p>Now stood, APOLLO holds onto a lab-coat and looks down towards ARTEMIS.</p><p>He reaches his arm down towards her.</p><p>She looks up, her eyes smiling but her mouth not knowing how.</p><p>She reaches for APOLLO's forearm and clutches at it.</p><p>APOLLO begins heaving her to her feat.</p><p>ORION too offers his assistance, placing his arm around ARTEMIS to support her as she stands.</p><p>Finally standing, she clutches the wall to keep herself up.</p><p>ORION gently strokes his hand up her back, releasing the support she no longer needs.</p><p>As his hand caresses upwards to her neck, he looks at ARTEMIS with contemplation.</p><p>She glances toward him with confusion then looks to her brother, APOLLO.</p><p>She removes one hand from the wall and rests her arm on APOLLO's shoulder.</p><p>His mouth cracks to form a primitive smile and he raises one hand to her face, to stroke her with affirmation for her accomplishment.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - LATER</h3><p>Across the room from ZAGREUS, APOLLO, ORION, HEPHAESTUS and ARTEMIS, ATHENA is still stood against the wall.</p><p>ATHENA has helped THEBE, LOCRUS and AMPHION to stand and they support themselves clumsily along the wall beside her.</p><p>As ATHENA looks across the room to HEPHAESTUS and the others, AMPHION is helping his twin brother ZETHUS to stand.</p><p>As AMPHION hoists ZETHUS upwards, ATHENA steps forwards.</p><p>She collapses downwards to the floor but catches herself in as controlled a form as she can.</p><p>She rests on her hands and feet in a squat-like position.</p><p>From this position, she steps and hops clumsily across the room toward HEPHAESTUS, ZAGREUS and those others still standing by the door and lab-coats.</p><p>ZAGREUS turns his gaze from ATHENA toward MELINOE, his sister.</p><p>He too now collapses from the wall and squats.</p><p>He hops toward MELINOE, who is examining the lifeless forms of ALAGONIA and HARMONIA.</p><p>ATHENA arrives at the doorway next to HEPHAESTUS.</p><p>She raises her hand up it and presses, collecting her weight and standing.</p><p>Standing with her weight against the door, she looks into a window in it and catches sight of her reflection.</p><p>ATHENA leans in to look at her reflection and raises a hand to the glass in greeting it.</p><p>But it is cold, and a shock to her that this other person doesn't feel warm like others.</p><p>She rests her hand there as condensation fogs the glass around it.</p><p>ATHENA loses sight of the girl, her reflection, and begins to examine the rest of the door and the surrounding features.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS watches her examine the door.</p><p>ORION too watches, from his position sat on the floor by HEPHAESTUS' feet.</p><p>ARTEMIS sits next to him, with her brother APOLLO still stood beside her.</p><p>ARTEMIS looks out to ZAGREUS who attentively sits by his own sister, MELINOE.</p><p>MELINOE still shows no interest in the living and continues examining the corpse of HARMONIA.</p><p>APOLLO clutches at a lab-coat and looks down to his sister, then out to ZAGREUS and MELINOE.</p><p>He sees that ARTEMIS is clutching her legs with her arms and shivering, then looks back to the lab-coat he still clutches to keep himself stood.</p><p>Instead, he moves his hands to hold a coat-hook and tugs the lab-coat violently in a bid to remove it from the wall.</p><p>It comes loose, a key-card flying from its pocket as it manages to do so.</p><p>APOLLO pays little attention to this, but HEPHAESTUS notes it and drops to reach for it.</p><p>Ignoring this, APOLLO crouches to his sister and drapes the coat around her.</p><p>ARTEMIS looks to him as he does so and leans toward him.</p><p>She clutches the coat tightly around her and leans into APOLLO who collapses against the wall with her weight against him.</p><p>But he accepts this and sits, manoeuvring his arm to support her.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>HEPHAESTUS examines the key-card in his hands as APOLLO, behind him, turns between him and ATHENA.</p><p>APOLLO merely watches as ATHENA and HEPHAESTUS examine their respective objects.</p><p>ATHENA continues to examine the door, having found its most curious feature - a colour-coded key-card scanner.</p><p>She admires the bright green colour of it, having seen nothing like it in the rest of the room.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS too examines the green colour of the key-card in his hands.</p><p>ATHENA soon gives up on the door and turns from it.</p><p>She slumps down against it, defeated and beginning to quiver with tears that could surface at any moment.</p><p>But she catches sight of the key-card in HEPHAESTUS' hands.</p><p>ATHENA ceases quivering. She leans forward suddenly in surprise.</p><p>She looks from the key-card back to the key-card scanner.</p><p>ATHENA squats upright and then hops toward HEPHAESTUS.</p><p>She reaches to his hands and snatches the key-card from him.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS screeches at her possessively as she takes it.</p><p>She shows no concern and hops back toward the door.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>MELINOE now has reached the height of her curiosity with the dead.</p><p>Rather than continue to caress the back of HARMONIA, she reaches beneath her shoulder and attempts to lift the corpse.</p><p>She is gentle and respectful as she does so, but ZAGREUS takes shock at this.</p><p>ZAGREUS moves quickly, spasming forward as though ready to attempt to stop her.</p><p>He holds himself back, merely reaching out, confused at what his muscles would like him to do.</p><p>MELINOE finally rolls HARMONIA into a position where the blood discoloured front of her corpse can be witnessed.</p><p>ZAGREUS reaches to MELINOE's shoulder as though to try and pull her away.</p><p>But MELINOE only leans in closer to the body.</p><p>She caresses HARMONIA's face and neck, then strokes her shoulder and finds her name-branding on the collar-bone.</p><p>MELINOE presses and rubs the name on HARMONIA's collar bone, noting the strange shapes of symbols there - “HARMONIA”.</p><p>There is a click and a swish from across the room.</p><p>ZAGREUS turns quickly to look and sees that ATHENA has now gotten the door open.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>ATHENA presses the key-card to the key-card scanner as the door slides open.</p><p>She is curious and, clutching the key-card in hand, steps partially through the door to examine the corridor beyond.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS too is now curious, no longer angry at ATHENA.</p><p>He approaches the door and lifts himself up against the wall to look through it.</p><p>All around the room, others now look toward the door and begin to move towards it.</p><p>ORION hoists himself up against the wall.</p><p>ARTEMIS, who was beside him looks up and leans forward from her brother's shoulder to look through the door.</p><p>APOLLO, freed from her weight, leans forward to look as well.</p><p>ZAGREUS is looking longingly outward at the door and begins to move forward.</p><p>He halts and looks behind him.</p><p>MELINOE still only has interest for the dead.</p><p>She continues to stroke the name on HARMONIA's collar-bone, “HARMONIA”.</p><p>ZAGREUS moves to MELINOE and clutches her shoulder.</p><p>He tugs at her, insistently, and she turns to him.</p><p>He moves his hand down her shoulder, to her arm and clutches it to tug her toward the door.</p><p>She is reluctant, casting a glance back to the lifeless body of HARMONIA.</p><p>ZAGREUS sits in wait, as MELINOE returns her hands to HARMONIA.</p><p>She manoeuvres the corpse back to its original position so that HARMONIA is left face-down against the floor.</p><p>Then MELINOE accompanies her brother.</p><p>She follows as he leads them towards the door.</p><p>Others around them do the same, and the group of living people file out of the laboratory.</p><h3>EXT. LAB EXIT, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>A door slides open on a small structure which appears to lead underground.</p><p>Out from it, ATHENA is the first to hop onto the worn dirt at the exit.</p><p>She halts, feeling the dirt in her fingertips.</p><p>ZAGREUS follows her out of the structure, followed by HEPHAESTUS then ORION.</p><p>APOLLO and ARTEMIS are next out, moving in close proximity to one another as he tends his interest to her; her own interest is in looking upward.</p><p>Trees extend high into the bright white above them, a light which shines in a long line straight across the sky. From this, a bright blue extends downwards towards the two horizons either side of the streak of light; its bright blue diminishing into a deep, dark navy colour into the distances.</p><p>ATHENA leans toward the ground and sniffs it; she continues to sniff it as if there is some greatly invigorating scent coming from the dirt.</p><p>She licks the ground, then swirls it in her mouth a second before spitting.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS meanwhile has made his way to the grass.</p><p>He hears ATHENA spit and turns to see her. Then he turns back to the grass and picks some; he places it in his mouth.</p><p>Holding his fingers to his mouth as he chews, he continues to search the grass with his eyes then finds a tree extending from the ground.</p><p>He hops towards it, places one hand against it then leans in to the tree.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS licks the tree, then recoils from its taste and texture.</p><p>ZAGREUS moves beyond HEPHAESTUS, into the trees. He looks into the forest, contemplative of the surroundings.</p><p>Far in the distance, there is darkness, but the trees remain lightly packed enough to let through a generous helping of light nearby. Still, they are dense enough to conceal hidden threats.</p><p>As APOLLO and ARTEMIS make their way toward the grass where HEPHAESTUS continues to sample the flavours of grass and flowers, APOLLO halts.</p><p>ARTEMIS continues and stops at the grass, crouching to sniff it.</p><p>APOLLO remains still, thrusting himself somewhat upright and looking towards a line of trees and bushes.</p><p>There is a rustling from beyond the bushes.</p><p>ORION too now looks toward the bushes with APOLLO, and ARTEMIS raises herself from the grass to look.</p><p>A sheep suddenly darts out from the bushes and bounds through the opening.</p><p>It halts as it is startled by the group.</p><p>ORION leans forward as though to begin a motion toward the sheep.</p><p>But quickly the sheep bounds away again, darting through the group and back into the trees.</p><p>There is a growl from beyond the bushes and a rustling once more.</p><p>Then a dog, of a sheep herding breed but now wild, emerges quickly and on the hunt.</p><p>It dashes through the group and leaps at ARTEMIS.</p><p>She is toppled to the ground.</p><p>Many of the group quickly start to hop away into the trees, many finding themselves able to run upright clumsily.</p><p>HERMES is the quickest into the trees and bounds with some show of talent for running, though supporting himself clumsily with tree branches.</p><p>MELINOE remains and watches from near the laboratory exit hatch, her expressions attentive; she leans toward the action and reaches out a concerned hand though she is far away.</p><p>ZAGREUS, ORION and APOLLO also remain.</p><p>ZAGREUS merely watches from the tree-line, while ORION is quick to bound towards ARTEMIS and the dog.</p><p>APOLLO follows quickly after ORION.</p><p>ORION leaps at the dog and throws it off ARTEMIS.</p><p>He pins it to the ground with the weight of his body, as it snaps and snarls at him.</p><p>Instinctively, he raises his hand into the air and begins slapping his palm down against the dog.</p><p>With every succession, his hand resembles a fist more and more and ORION continues to beat the dog.</p><p>APOLLO approaches ARTEMIS and helps her back upright.</p><p>She clutches at him with white-knuckled, strong, panicked grasps.</p><p>APOLLO clumsily tries to get between her grasps and pull her towards the treeline.</p><p>She is difficult to calm and to move.</p><p>Instead, APOLLO wraps his arms around her and sits with her on the floor, hugging her tightly.</p><p>As ORION beats the dog, it has since stopped moving.</p><p>ZAGREUS moves toward him, calmly and slowly.</p><p>He places his hand on ORION's shoulder and tugs him to indicate motion toward the trees, to follow the others.</p><p>ORION calms and stops beating the dog.</p><p>He looks to ZAGREUS, to the treeline, and then to ARTEMIS and APOLLO.</p><p>He leaves ZAGREUS' grasp to move toward ARTEMIS and APOLLO.</p><p>Gently he greets ARTEMIS by raising his hand to her face.</p><p>ZAGREUS looks toward MELINOE, as she moves toward him and the dead, beaten dog.</p><p>She rests beside him and looks at the dog, motionless.</p><p>Her face turns contemplative and she looks back toward ORION, who is now examining his own hand for the blood and saliva which covers it.</p><p>She looks back to the dog but catches sight of ZAGREUS extending his arm to her.</p><p>He grasps her shoulder and tugs it in the direction of the treeline.</p><p>She looks to it, indicating her understanding, then lets her brother set out first and follows him.</p><p>As they leave, ZAGREUS looks back to ORION.</p><p>ORION looks to ZAGREUS, then to APOLLO and ARTEMIS.</p><p>He puts one hand to APOLLO's shoulder then raises his other arm in the direction of the treeline.</p><p>APOLLO looks to it and understands.</p><p>He hugs ARTEMIS  more tightly, grazing his face against her cheek, then lets her loose so that they each can move to leave.</p><p>ORION sets out to follow MELINOE and ZAGREUS.</p><p>ARTEMIS watches, then looks to APOLLO, then to the treeline.</p><p>She sets out in following ORION, her brother at her side.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - DAY</h3><p>HERMES darts out of the trees, and stumbles to the ground having no more branches to support his upright run.</p><p>He hits it, hard, and groans loudly.</p><p>Manoeuvring his arms slowly, he presses down against the earth and pushes his torso upwards.</p><p>He looks out ahead of himself and sees the farmhouse.</p><p>The farmhouse appears as a strange combination of rustic and ultramodern; partially constructed of wood, particularly in its frame, yet with a lot of steel and polymers apparent in its structure.</p><p>HERMES clambers into an upright squat and admires the farmhouse.</p><p>He looks behind himself, back into the forest; there is no sign of danger anymore.</p><p>He moves forward toward the farmhouse, walking across the ground on all fours.</p><p>As he reaches a fence, he uses it to hoist himself into a standing position then looks back into the forest.</p><p>He can see others still trying to dash away from the dog that had chased them.</p><p>HERMES yells to them.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>HERMES</h4><p>YAAH! AAH! AH!</p></div> <p>KEROESSA is first to emerge from the forest, and to hear HERMES' cry.</p><p>She halts and looks at him, then continues to make motion towards him more calmly as the twins AMPHION and ZETHUS emerge tentatively from the trees behind her.</p><p>The twins remain flustered, staring back over their shoulders in case of danger, but follow KEROESSA toward HERMES.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - DAY</h3><p>ZAGREUS emerges from the trees, followed by ORION and MELINOE.</p><p>He is bewildered by the farmhouse but carries on towards it.</p><p>ORION too is bewildered, staring around at the clearing the farmhouse finds itself placed within.</p><p>MELINOE appears the least interested, only passively observing her surroundings.</p><p>APOLLO and ARTEMIS soon follow them out of the trees.</p><p>ARTEMIS continues onwards, staring attentively at the surroundings and the farmhouse.</p><p>APOLLO stops and uses a tree to hold himself upright.</p><p>He looks with perplexed admiration at the farmhouse.</p><p>As he stares at it, he returns to his crouched position and first sets off slowly towards it, then looks to ARTEMIS.</p><p>He quickens to catch up to her.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - DAY</h3><p>APOLLO, ARTEMIS, ORION, ZAGREUS, MELINOE, HELLEN and GRACEUS remain outside the farmhouse.</p><p>APOLLO is admiring nearby fields, with ARTEMIS sat by his side.</p><p>She rises from her sitting and moves toward the farmhouse.</p><p>APOLLO watches her go briefly but turns back to the fields and looks out at the expanse of land.</p><p>ORION, having been examining a disused object of technology, looks to ARTEMIS as she heads toward the farmhouse.</p><p>She arrives at the door and enters it.</p><p>ZAGREUS, who was near to the door, watches her enter and follows her inside.</p><p>MELINOE remains sat against the wall outside.</p><p>ORION too makes his way toward the farmhouse, HELLEN and GRACEUS choosing to follow him.</p><p>APOLLO casts his gaze away from the fields and up towards the sky.</p><p>It remains blue with a strong streak of white down its middle, but a moment later rain begins to fall.</p><p>APOLLO attempts to stand upwards into the rain.</p><p>He opens his mouth and lets droplets hit his tongue as the rain falls heavier.</p><p>The rain falls more and more heavily as APOLLO drinks it in.</p><p>The sky barely changes, but is ablaze with colour as the light is refracted in the rain.</p><p>APOLLO shakes himself, trying to shed the rainwater, but it persists in falling.</p><p>He tentatively puts himself in position to move indoors, but waits.</p><p>Looking up at the colours which dance across the sky, he moves slowly.</p><p>MELINOE nervously peers out from beneath the farmhouse's awning.</p><p>As APOLLO passes, he puts his hand on her arm and tugs.</p><p>She looks up to him, then collects herself.</p><p>The pair then quickly move inside and close the door behind them.</p><p>Then onwards, the only motion or sound of the outside is of the rain and the colours which dance across the sky above.</p><p>Water cascades down the roof, the wall and the windows of the little farmhouse.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - DAY, SOMETIME MUCH LATER</h3><p>Water drips from the awning of the farmhouse into a filled bucket below.</p><p>A shadow is cast over the bucket as two hands reach for its rim.</p><p>MELINOE lifts the bucket of water.</p><p>She walks back to the front door of the farmhouse as we see that she is now basically clothed, with a non-fitting, open jacket and some trousers, precariously tied up at her waist.</p><p>APOLLO exits the front door of the farmhouse and greets MELINOE by gently stroking her face.</p><p>She smiles at his greeting.</p><p>APOLLO steps aside and allows MELINOE to enter the farmhouse.</p><p>He walks out into the open, with a strange stride as though unconfident still that his feet could support his body.</p><p>He stares towards the fields then across the forest.</p><p>ORION emerges from the forest with a freshly killed dog draped over his shoulders.</p><p>APOLLO turns and walks to where the remains of a previous dog are hung over the ashes of a dead fire.</p><p>He tears a piece of the dogs flesh away with his hands, then takes it to his mouth and eats it.</p><p>He looks back to ORION at the edge of the forest and sees his sister, ARTEMIS, following the huntsman.</p><p>APOLLO strides towards them.</p><p>ARTEMIS picks up her pace and overtakes ORION to meet her brother.</p><p>As she greets him, she strokes his face and he strokes hers.</p><p>Then she walks beyond APOLLO to the carcass of the previous dog and collects some meat for herself.</p><p>APOLLO greets ORION in the same way with which he had greeted his sister, by caressing ORION's face gently.</p><p>ORION swings the fresh kill from off his shoulders and presents it to APOLLO.</p><p>APOLLO collects the dog from ORION and ORION caresses his face.</p><p>APOLLO turns away from ORION and carries the dog toward the carcass of the last meal, and to ARTEMIS still standing by it.</p><p>From the edge of the fields, ZAGREUS has been watching the actions of his fellowmen.</p><p>He sees ORION moving towards him.</p><p>But then he turns back and looks out across the fields.</p><p>He longs for journey outside of their established territory.</p><p>ORION arrives alongside ZAGREUS and signifies his presence.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ORION</h4><p>Ogh!</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>ZAGREUS</h4><p>Mh.</p></div> <p>ORION places one hand on ZAGREUS' shoulder, precariously held to meet with the flesh of his neck; rather than merely the fabric of his clothing.</p><p>ZAGREUS raises his arm and gestures out over the fields.</p><p>He looks to ORION.</p><p>ORION seems not to understand.</p><p>ZAGREUS raises both his arms and gestures, waving his arms outwards repeatedly.</p><p>ORION watches then looks into ZAGREUS' face.</p><p>He then looks back out across the fields and takes a step forward.</p><p>ZAGREUS clutches at ORION's arm and draws him back.</p><p>He steps in front of ORION and gestures.</p><p>First he thrusts his hands into ORION's chest, then at his own chest and then toward the farmhouse.</p><p>ORION turns toward the farmhouse.</p><p>He looks back to ZAGREUS and places one hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Then he raises his other hand and gently caresses ZAGREUS' face.</p><p>The two turn back to the farmhouse and walk to return to it.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT</h3><p>The group sit around the crackling embers of a fire beneath the cooking torso of a dog.</p><p>ZAGREUS and ORION are the centre of attention as they tell gestures of their want to go exploring.</p><p>ZAGREUS takes lead, gesturing to himself and then thrusting his arms away into the distance.</p><p>APOLLO appears concerned.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>APOLLO</h4><p>Agh!</p></div> <p>APOLLO raises his arm as ZAGREUS stops to look at him.</p><p>APOLLO then lowers his hand to the ground and pats it, gesturing his wish to stay.</p><p>ARTEMIS is sat beside him and views his motions understandingly, but with contemplation of her own.</p><p>It is ATHENA who first stands and approaches ZAGREUS.</p><p>She steps to him then raises her hand to his face and strokes it gently, finally resting her hand on his shoulder.</p><p>She turns back to the rest of the group but remains standing with ZAGREUS and ORION.</p><p>LACEDAEMON then stands, and HELLEN beside him watches.</p><p>LACEDAEMON approaches ZAGREUS and strokes his face.</p><p>HELLEN then stands too.</p><p>He is tentative for a moment then approaches ZAGREUS and does the same.</p><p>ZAGREUS strokes his face in reciprocation, now elating in the support.</p><p>ARTEMIS then stands, her brother APOLLO looking up to her with muzzled shock.</p><p>She extends her arm to him invitingly.</p><p>APOLLO lowers his hand to the ground and pats it once more, then looks up to ARTEMIS pleadingly.</p><p>ARTEMIS bows her head to the ground, then swallows her fear and turns to ZAGREUS.</p><p>She caresses ZAGREUS' face and then ORION's as she stands between them.</p><p>APOLLO jumps up into a squat and then moves away from the group, quicker for being on all-fours.</p><p>ARTEMIS watches, then follows; slower as she walks.</p><p>APOLLO rests himself against the farmhouse then sees ARTEMIS coming to join him.</p><p>She sits against the farmhouse beside him.</p><p>He gestures to the ground, patting it.</p><p>She shows no will to change her mind and thumps her bosom before gesturing outwards toward the fields.</p><p>APOLLO bows his head, defeated.</p><p>ARTEMIS puts a hand to his face and strokes it.</p><p>He raises his head and she smiles at him as he does so.</p><p>Then she rests her head against his shoulder.</p><p>He raises his arm to put it around her, and holds her in an embrace.</p><h3>EXT.

A FENCE, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>Led by ZAGREUS, ARTEMIS, HERMES, ORION, ATHENA, HELLEN, LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS walk through the forest.</p><p>Their strides are clumsy and tentative and most use the dense array of trees to support themselves.</p><p>ATHENA follows ZAGREUS most closely, looking at the environment around them as though to assess it.</p><p>ORION strides almost alongside her with ARTEMIS following closely behind him.</p><p>As they head through the dense forest, the well-trodden path in front of them seems to lead to light ahead, a clearing.</p><p>ZAGREUS is cautious, lowering himself to the ground as they approach.

OBSERVATION HALLWAY - DAY</h3><p>COEUS, a man in his fifties, stands observing through the glass of the observation hallway high above the forest.</p><p>He is looking down towards the farm, where KEROESSA, THEBE, AMPHION, HEPHAESTUS and APOLLO are seen performing various tasks or sitting around a roasted animal, taking from and eating its flesh.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ASTERIA</h4><p>Dad?</p></div> <p>COEUS' daughter, a young teenage girl, ASTERIA is sat on the ground behind him.</p><p>She is sat with a collection of basic rations, a large camping rucksack and a pair of sleeping bags.</p><p>COEUS turns to his daughter.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>Don't worry, sweetie.

COMMUNAL PLAZA - DAY</h3><p>The communal plaza sits at the centre of a semicircle of tall, segmented buildings, each efficiently stacked and divided into rows and columns of equally spacious rooms and lobbies.</p><p>The plaza is beautiful, with vegetation and a great three-dimensional structure at its centre, which acts as a map of the world itself - incorporating the plaza, the residential district behind it and the forest which lays beyond a large steel, mechanically operated door directly ahead of the sculpture.</p><p>In the plaza, people gather and communicate with one another.</p><p>Many stand facing the large door as they converse, in wait of its opening.</p><p>To one side of the plaza, COEUS and ASTERIA emerge onto a walkway from beyond a door which appears to have been forced ajar and then held open with a make-shift wedge.</p><p>ASTERIA lets her father walk along the walkway ahead of her, as she removes the wedge from the door and allows it to shut.</p><p>She then follows COEUS towards a ladder.</p><p>He has waited for her and lets her descend first.</p><p>In the plaza below, some have noticed the return of COEUS and ASTERIA and have begun to turn and shift towards them.</p><p>COEUS and ASTERIA enter the plaza, COEUS greeting people as they pass them by.</p><p>ASTERIA stays close to her father, nervous of the crowds interest in them.</p><p>A man of similar age to COEUS moves quickly through the crowd towards him.</p><p>This man is CRONUS.</p><p>He allows COEUS to remove his rucksack and drop it to the ground before greeting him.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>Coe!</p></div> <p>He extends a hand to COEUS as he reaches only arm's length distance from him.</p><p>COEUS shakes his hand.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>Cro.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>What have you found?</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>Trouble...

We have spent two nights looking over the farms of the forest and we have seen trouble for us all. It is not the extended quarantine we had feared, though it is perhaps worse.</p></div> <p>Hushed whispers in the crowd elevate in volume slightly.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>COEUS (CONT'D)</h4><p>The forest contains people, new people! Dwelling in the farmhouse; they forage food and hunt animals. I don't know their purpose, and I couldn't presume. But it seems our rightful place, and those jobs which many of us found our livelihood, have been taken from us and given to these new people! I can only think they must have been grown very rapidly; they behave strangely so I believe they've experienced a stunted development. But if they can prove efficient in our former roles, I fear for us. I fear our superiors are breeding our successors; a breed of slaves.</p></div> <p>Whispers in the crowd grow louder still as people begin to engage in discussion and COEUS steps down from the sculpture.</p><p>There is a large rush of people demanding to talk to him more.</p><p>It is THEMIS, a woman of his age, who first manages to grab his attention.</p><p>She leans into him to speak her mind intimately.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>You've caused a bit of an uproar.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>I have evidence; Cro has my camera.</p></div> <p>COEUS walks back towards ASTERIA and CRONUS with THEMIS alongside him.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>Coeus... you must admit that these presumptions are just that.</p></div> <p>COEUS arrives at CRONUS and ASTERIA.</p><p>He retrieves his camera from CRONUS and hands it to THEMIS.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>See for yourself.</p></div> <p>There is a sudden loud grinding as the large door to the forest begins to open.</p><p>The crowd hushes, ceasing to harass COEUS, as people look towards the door.</p><p>THEMIS continues to examine pictures on COEUS' camera.</p><h3>EXT. DOOR TO THE FOREST, COMMUNAL PLAZA - DAY</h3><p>The large door to the forest opens and two heavy trucks pull into the communal plaza.</p><p>Armed guards walk in with them, several staying at the door to protect the exit.</p><p>The door is almost completely shut again, to keep anyone from trying to get through.</p><p>The two trucks turn and stop in the plaza so that their rear doors are somewhat facing the gathered crowd of citizens.</p><p>Guards then open up the doors of the trucks and begin to unload supplies as the crowd draws closer to them.</p><p>There are shouts from the crowd, at the guards, and a commotion at the front as people collecting boxes attempt to question them.</p><p>EREBUS, the commanding guard, climbs up to the top of a truck.</p><p>He raises a microphone to his mouth and his voice is amplified through the trucks' speaker systems.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>EREBUS</h4><p>People!

Please remain vigilant in abiding by our law. The forest is restricted for your own protection!</p></div> <p>The trucks start up their engines and begin to move as guards in their bellies quickly throw out the remaining ration crates.</p><p>The crowd grows further restless as two guards open the door for the trucks to get through.</p><p>EREBUS is forced to back away from the advancing crowd.</p><p>He clings to the side of a truck as it drives for the door and out through it.</p><p>The other truck follows as the crowd of people rushes forward to try and burst through or to attack the guards.</p><p>The several guards defending the door hold their ground.</p><p>As one of the CITIZENs burst through their defence, a GUARD turns and fires his gun at him.</p><p>There is a bright flash and a straight jet of electric-white light emitted from the gun, accompanied by a large crack, a thunderous bang!</p><p>The CITIZEN is knocked down and quivers on the ground, just inside the forest.</p><p>The GUARD returns his sight to the restless crowds who remain now hesitant to advance.</p><p>Two guards in the forest, lift the exhausted CITIZEN and drag him back into the plaza.</p><p>The remainder of the guards back away into the forest, where the two trucks and two jeeps await them.</p><p>As they cross the threshold, the doors to the forest are closed and sealed behind them.</p><p>A number of the crowd advance to tend to the electrocuted CITIZEN who is still in shock.</p><p>THEMIS turns and authoritatively walks toward COEUS, CRONUS and ASTERIA.</p><p>She stops in front of COEUS and hands his camera back to him.</p><p>Then she turns to CRONUS.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>So, Cro...

A ROAD, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>The convoy of two trucks and two jeeps drives down the main road through the forest.</p><p>They pass by trees along their way.</p><p>Deep in the trees, ATHENA hears the convoy and turns her attention to where the sound is coming from.</p><p>She turns back to ZAGREUS whose attention has been caught too.</p><p>LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS sit tending to the exhausted and injured HELLEN.</p><p>ZAGREUS quickly bursts into a run towards the sound of the convoy.</p><p>ATHENA follows after him and HERMES sets off after her.</p><p>ZAGREUS halts near to the road and ATHENA comes to a stop behind him.</p><p>HERMES keeps further back.</p><p>ZAGREUS and ATHENA watch as the convoy passes along the road, their vehicles containing many guards, along with EREBUS.</p><p>HERMES draws himself closer to the rear of ZAGREUS and ATHENA as he watches the convoy too.</p><p>Quickly the convoy has passed, and the group cautiously crawl out onto the road.</p><p>ZAGREUS looks down to where the convoy is heading.</p><p>ATHENA examines the road, dust still dancing through the air from the disruption of the trucks and jeeps.</p><p>HERMES remains in the trees, staring also down toward the fast disappearing convoy.</p><p>A little way up the road, ORION emerges from the trees with ARTEMIS close by him.</p><p>They too look towards the convoy, then turn to look back up the other way.</p><p>Their attention meets with the presence of ZAGREUS and ATHENA.</p><p>Then all look back to the convoy.</p><p>ZAGREUS is first to begin moving back into the trees.</p><p>ORION and ARTEMIS slowly make their way up the road together, to follow him.</p><p>ATHENA too follows, after HERMES who is close on ZAGREUS' tail.</p><h3>EXT. SECURITY FACILITY, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>The convoy of two trucks and two jeeps arrives back at base-camp; a large complex built over-ground, well defended as though a fort.</p><p>Two guards stand at the entrance, and open the gate to the trucks.</p><p>Inside the courtyard, the guards on board each truck and in the jeeps unload.</p><p>EREBUS strides out ahead of most to meet with their superior, CHAOS.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHAOS</h4><p>You mentioned bad news.</p></div> <p>CHAOS turns with EREBUS to walk with him back to the entrance of the security complex.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>EREBUS</h4><p>Yes sir. The civilians have found out about the human-beta project, sir. They have pictures, and their people are restless in want of answers.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>CHAOS</h4><p>Hmm... We'll have to discuss something. Perhaps it's almost time I addressed them.</p></div> <p>CHAOS opens the door to the facility but holds it open for EREBUS.</p><p>EREBUS walks through and CHAOS follows him in.</p><h3>INT. SUBWAY STATION, COMMUNAL PLAZA - NIGHT</h3><p>A group of civilians break through the locks on a gate to the subway platform.</p><p>They draw the gates aside to allow a passage through.</p><p>CRONUS, COEUS and ASTERIA pass through the gap, followed by THEMIS.</p><p>Other civilians accompany them.</p><p>CRONUS addresses the group.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>We can use the subway to get to the forest's central station. From there, it's only a short journey to the farm; a few kilometres.</p></div> <p>The group are divided into those prepared for a journey, and those not.</p><p>COEUS and ASTERIA have a rucksack between them; she carries lighter goods in her hands.</p><p>CRONUS too is packed for the journey.</p><p>Other civilians are packing the equipment used to break the gate back into another rucksack.</p><p>They join CRONUS, COEUS and ASTERIA.</p><p>THEMIS stands at the other side of them, to stay behind.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>You all have double rations for the next two weeks; try to make them last. When you meet with the new people, try to stay with them; observe what they do, communicate with them.

This is a reconnaissance mission.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>It's early. I don't want you to act in any way that might harm them, but we have to consider them a threat to us... to our privilege to remain civilians of Mnemosyne.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>We're expensive, they're not. We have needs as civilians and as consumers, we have wants. If they're to be bred as slaves, they will have little of either.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>That's right. Do what you must. Observe them before you try to meet them; if they are hostile, cease engagement, return and we'll consider our options.</p></div> <p>COEUS appears concerned.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>THEMIS (CONT'D)</h4><p>Coeus, you have a problem?</p></div> <p>He looks to THEMIS.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>No, ma'am.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>All right. Not for want to sound military but... move out!</p></div> <p>COEUS nods, he and some of the others including ASTERIA at his side begin to move onto the tracks and into the subway tunnel.</p><p>Others embrace persons of the other group before doing the same.</p><p>CRONUS stays to speak intimately to THEMIS.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>Well then... See you in a fortnight or two.</p></div> <p>He hugs her, to her reciprocation.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>Stay as long as you can.</p></div> <p>Their embrace stops and he smiles at her before setting out to walk with the rest of the group into the tunnel.</p><h3>EXT. A ROAD, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>ZAGREUS, HELLEN, LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS walk down the centre of the road.</p><p>ZAGREUS leads, with LACEDAEMON behind.</p><p>HELLEN appears to limp but has healed well and appears to walk with only minor discomfort.</p><p>GRACEUS follows him from the rear of the group.</p><p>ATHENA and HERMES walk to the edge of the road, carrying foraged fruits and vegetation.</p><p>ATHENA leads, examining the trees about them carefully for more food.</p><h3>EXT. THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>ARTEMIS searches the ground for tracks, moving quickly along the forest floor in the process of hunting.</p><p>ORION is not too far behind her, searching through the trees around them for sign of a meal.</p><p>There appears to be none coming.</p><p>Still ARTEMIS searches, hunting.</p><p>ORION halts, dismayed at the lack of prey.</p><p>ARTEMIS continues to scour the floor.</p><p>She halts, leaning into herself with discomfort on her face.</p><p>She clutches at her stomach.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ARTEMIS</h4><p>Uugh!</p></div> <p>ORION moves quickly to her.</p><p>He puts his hand on her back and looks toward her face.</p><p>She looks up to him.</p><p>In a moment, she turns away, recovers and returns to scouring the forest floor.</p><p>ORION, confused and concerned, freezes for a second or two before continuing to follow her.</p><h3>INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM, SECURITY FACILITY - DAY</h3><p>The room is dark, its light mainly coming from the glow of many monitors which show different regions of Mnemosyne's outer environments.</p><p>HEMERA is the lone security technician and psychologist in charge of monitoring the beta-subjects.</p><p>The screens directly in front of her show the farmhouse, its interiors and exteriors, the road where ZAGREUS and others are still walking, and of particular focus the forest nearby where ARTEMIS and ORION continue to hunt.</p><p>HEMERA types a note into her tablet computer.</p><p>There is a knock at the door.</p><p>HEMERA turns to see her superior, another psychologist, enter.</p><p>ANANKE walks to HEMERA and stands over the monitors next to her.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ANANKE</h4><p>Any news?</p></div> <p>HEMERA smiles at ANANKE.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>HEMERA</h4><p>Big news!

She and uhmm...</p></div> <p>HEMERA checks her notes.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>HEMERA (CONT'D)</h4><p>She and Orion only copulated a week ago, but the signs are showing.</p></div> <p>ANANKE looks to HEMERA.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ANANKE</h4><p>A week?</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>HEMERA</h4><p>Uhm...</p></div> <p>HEMERA checks her notes again.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>HEMERA (CONT'D)</h4><p>Nine days. But I've noted subtle signs for the past twelve hours.</p></div> <p>ANANKE smiles.</p><p>She sits down next to HEMERA.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ANANKE</h4><p>Take me through your notes.</p></div> <h3>EXT. CENTRAL STATION, THE FOREST - DUSK</h3><p>CRONUS and his group exit the subway station.</p><p>COEUS and ASTERIA are close behind him.</p><p>CRONUS examines the area and looks up to the sky.</p><p>He turns to the rest of the group.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>We should head back into the station to make camp. Last thing we want is to be seen out here before morning. The road is nearby, but we'll avoid it; there's only one crossing that will be necessary on our way to the farm tomorrow.</p></div> <p>He looks up towards the sky.</p><p>The light-streak which stretches out across the centre of the sky is fading and the blue either side of it gradually darkening.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CRONUS (CONT'D)</h4><p>It's almost night... Coe?</p></div> <p>COEUS takes his cue and addresses the rest of the group.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>There could still be wild dogs in the forest.

It will keep us safe; let us be alert... Head inside and set up.</p></div> <p>The group shuffles and collects their items, moving back into the subway.</p><p>CRONUS turns and looks out through the trees.</p><p>COEUS walks to him.</p><p>ASTERIA stands waiting for her father to walk back.</p><p>COEUS puts his hand on CRONUS' shoulder.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>Come on.</p></div> <p>CRONUS turns to COEUS and the pair walk back to ASTERIA.</p><p>She joins them and they all walk back into the subway.</p><h3>EXT. A DOOR, THE FOREST - DUSK</h3><p>ZAGREUS, HERMES and ATHENA exit the forest's dense trees ahead of GRACEUS, LACEDAEMON and HELLEN.</p><p>They meet with an opening which reconnects to the main road extending far through the forest behind them.</p><p>ZAGREUS halts and marvels at the object in front of him, casting his sights far up it.</p><p>ATHENA too marvels but continues moving.</p><p>She turns to excitement and makes a run towards it.</p><p>HERMES crouches to the ground and looks up at the marvel in front of them.</p><p>ORION and ARTEMIS, him trying to care to her for she appears exhausted, emerge last from the trees.</p><p>But ORION is then distracted from attempting to tend to ARTEMIS as he too is struck with awe by the massive object in front of them.</p><p>He halts as ARTEMIS carries on, looking up at the great object as she comes to rest at the floor next to HERMES.</p><p>The object that has them marvelling is a gigantic door, shining in the dimming light of dusk.</p><p>ATHENA has ran straight up to the door and is rubbing it.</p><p>She is able to see her reflection in the frosted metal of the door as she rubs her hand across it.</p><p>The speed with which darkness falls grows faster and ATHENA looks up toward the sky.</p><p>Up above, the streak of light which extends across the sky is here seen to have an end point from which it only extends continuously back down the main road.</p><p>ZAGREUS lowers himself to the ground.</p><p>ATHENA at the door does so too and crawls back toward the rest of the group.</p><p>They all turn and head back into the trees, disappearing in the darkness of the forest.</p><h3>EXT. A ROAD, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>Two jeeps and a truck drive quickly down the dirt road.</p><p>The jeeps sit ahead of and behind the truck and are loaded with armed guards.</p><p>In the trees, CRONUS and COEUS lay as low as they can to remain hidden.</p><p>They watch and remain silent as the convoy passes by.</p><p>With the jeeps and the truck moving quickly out of sight, COEUS and CRONUS rise to a crouch.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>They're not due again, are they?</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>Not for a month or so.</p></div> <p>COEUS leans out to see the convoy far in the distance.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>This is bad.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>Definitely...</p></div> <p>CRONUS stands.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CRONUS (CONT'D)</h4><p>We should keep moving.</p></div> <p>He turns backwards and looks through the trees behind him.</p><p>He whistles.</p><p>The rest of the group emerge cautiously from far behind.</p><p>ASTERIA is with them and walks most quickly to catch up to her father.</p><h3>EXT. DOOR TO THE COMMUNAL PLAZA, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>The front jeep of the convoy, consisting of itself, a truck and another jeep, arrives at the door.</p><p>It stops and the convoy halts behind it.</p><p>Three soldiers exit the jeep.</p><p>One walks to a console next to the door as the others stand in front of the door, guns raised.</p><p>The door slides open and the two soldiers walk through.</p><p>There is no gathering at the other side as they are not expected.</p><h3>EXT. DOOR TO THE FOREST, COMMUNAL PLAZA - DAY</h3><p>The convoy proceeds into the plaza, the first jeep followed by the truck and then the other jeep.</p><p>Two armed guards stand ahead of it, ready to defend.</p><p>In the plaza, people start to collect.</p><p>Others are rushing to bring more people and a gathering begins to build.</p><p>The jeeps and the truck come to a rest, having turned so that they can be ready to drive back out at any time.</p><p>Guards file out of the vehicles and form a defensive line between them and the gathering crowd ahead.</p><p>EREBUS is last to exit from the rear of the truck, after his men.</p><p>CHAOS exits the jeep which had been at the rear of the convoy.</p><p>The two men approach each other and briefly chat.</p><p>EREBUS leads CHAOS back to the truck, then lets him climb the ladder first.</p><p>EREBUS follows CHAOS up the ladder to the truck's roof.</p><p>He hands CHAOS the microphone.</p><p>CHAOS stands, waiting, and looks out over the crowd gathering ahead of them.</p><p>The crowd are cautious and remain stood some way back from the line of armed guards between them and the convoy.</p><p>CHAOS raises the microphone to his mouth.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHAOS</h4><p>People of Mnemosyne!</p></div> <p>THEMIS pushes her way through to the front of the crowd.</p><p>People are quick to move out of her way, acknowledging her official status.</p><p>She stands and looks directly up to CHAOS.</p><p>He looks directly at her before glancing across the rest of the crowd.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHAOS (CONT'D)</h4><p>For some time now we have held the forest off limits to you; many of you were told this was a part of the quarantine phase following our tragic pandemic. We, all of us lost our friends, our colleagues and our loved ones to that horrid illness. But we fought it, as best we could we fought it and it... and we could not defeat it. So it is true that the forest was held under quarantine for some time. But our populous lost innumerable lives before we could effectively defend ourselves against it. Testing since has revealed that those of us who remain are naturally immune to the contagion. This does not change the fact however, that we have restricted your access to the forest for the past six years in order to protect you! Your lives are invaluable, and your roles in the task ahead are irreplaceable.</p></div> <p>He pauses, looking over the crowd as some begin to whisper quietly to others.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHAOS (CONT'D)</h4><p>But it is true that we have experimented with breeding new humans.</p></div> <p>Whispers grow to murmurs and the crowd begins to shuffle restlessly.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHAOS (CONT'D)</h4><p>Please, settle down!</p></div> <p>The crowd quietens slightly.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHAOS (CONT'D)</h4><p>These humans are part of an experiment, they are a beta run of a concept proposed by our psychologist and genetic technician, Ananke Greco... As I have said, a great number of our populous was tragically lost. It is Ms. Greco's hypothesis that these beta-humans will be necessary for our survival as a species in the times ahead. They are of our own blood, kin to many of you who donated genetic samples; these are people just like us. And we believe that they are our only option to populate, to nurture a new ecosystem, and to develop our new world when we make dock.

MNEMOSYNE - SPACE</h3><p>From the outside of MNEMOSYNE, we see the betas swept through an opening doorway of the ship and into space.</p><p>The ship is incredibly vast, encompassing a large forest within a gigantic dome encompassing a small city at its middle which extends upwards and onto a tether, reaching far into space - to the ships pivotal point and counterweight far beyond that.</p><p>A giant text on her great dome reads “MNEMOSYNE”.</p><p>As it turns, a phrase is revealed above her bay door which extends around the rim of the ship.</p><p>It reads, “That they may not be forgotten.”</p><p>Still being flung from that door, are the betas, the civilians, the security, trees and all manner of debris from within.</p><p>The are lit by the lights from within, but those too die as cables are severed and generators are lost.</p><p>Little by little, the dome goes dark, and all within and outside of it are left unlit and unseen.</p><p>THE END.</p></div></article></div></div></main><footer data-v-119ebcc8><div class="social" data-v-27b35ff7 data-v-119ebcc8><ul data-v-27b35ff7><li data-v-27b35ff7><a href="https://facebook.com/thombruce" target="_blank" data-v-27b35ff7><span class="simple-icon" data-v-27b35ff7><svg role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>Facebook</title><path d="M24 12.073c0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12s-12 5.373-12 12c0 5.99 4.388 10.954 10.125 11.854v-8.385H7.078v-3.47h3.047V9.43c0-3.007 1.792-4.669 4.533-4.669 1.312 0 2.686.235 2.686.235v2.953H15.83c-1.491 0-1.956.925-1.956 1.874v2.25h3.328l-.532 3.47h-2.796v8.385C19.612 23.027 24 18.062 24 12.073z"/></svg></span></a></li><li data-v-27b35ff7><a href="https://twitter.com/thombruce" target="_blank" data-v-27b35ff7><span class="simple-icon" data-v-27b35ff7><svg role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>Twitter</title><path d="M23.953 4.57a10 10 0 01-2.825.775 4.958 4.958 0 002.163-2.723c-.951.555-2.005.959-3.127 1.184a4.92 4.92 0 00-8.384 4.482C7.69 8.095 4.067 6.13 1.64 3.162a4.822 4.822 0 00-.666 2.475c0 1.71.87 3.213 2.188 4.096a4.904 4.904 0 01-2.228-.616v.06a4.923 4.923 0 003.946 4.827 4.996 4.996 0 01-2.212.085 4.936 4.936 0 004.604 3.417 9.867 9.867 0 01-6.102 2.105c-.39 0-.779-.023-1.17-.067a13.995 13.995 0 007.557 2.209c9.053 0 13.998-7.496 13.998-13.985 0-.21 0-.42-.015-.63A9.935 9.935 0 0024 4.59z"/></svg></span></a></li><li data-v-27b35ff7><a href="https://github.com/thombruce" target="_blank" data-v-27b35ff7><span class="simple-icon" data-v-27b35ff7><svg role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>GitHub</title><path d="M12 .297c-6.63 0-12 5.373-12 12 0 5.303 3.438 9.8 8.205 11.385.6.113.82-.258.82-.577 0-.285-.01-1.04-.015-2.04-3.338.724-4.042-1.61-4.042-1.61C4.422 18.07 3.633 17.7 3.633 17.7c-1.087-.744.084-.729.084-.729 1.205.084 1.838 1.236 1.838 1.236 1.07 1.835 2.809 1.305 3.495.998.108-.776.417-1.305.76-1.605-2.665-.3-5.466-1.332-5.466-5.93 0-1.31.465-2.38 1.235-3.22-.135-.303-.54-1.523.105-3.176 0 0 1.005-.322 3.3 1.23.96-.267 1.98-.399 3-.405 1.02.006 2.04.138 3 .405 2.28-1.552 3.285-1.23 3.285-1.23.645 1.653.24 2.873.12 3.176.765.84 1.23 1.91 1.23 3.22 0 4.61-2.805 5.625-5.475 5.92.42.36.81 1.096.81 2.22 0 1.606-.015 2.896-.015 3.286 0 .315.21.69.825.57C20.565 22.092 24 17.592 24 12.297c0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12"/></svg></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="copyright" data-v-a82ffc02 data-v-119ebcc8>©
